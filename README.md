# keys-length [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/keys-length.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/keys-length)

> Get the length of the keys on an object. Much faster than Object.keys()

If you need the length of an object's properties, **excluding prototype properties**, use [object-length](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object-length)

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm i keys-length --save
```

## Usage

```js
var len = require('keys-length');

len({a: 'b', c: 'd', e: 'f'});
//=> 3
```
